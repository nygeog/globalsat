Building Bulk Density:

The purpose of this exercise was to identify street segments (city blocks) that we assumed would exhibit either high (of the upper quartile) GPS tracking error (via multipath or blocked line-of-sight interference) or low (of the lower quartile) GPS tracking error and then field test these street segments by walking down them with GPS devices, and comparing the travel distance observed by the GPS (point observation to point obervation distance calculations without correction) to the length of the segment walk. 

Using New York City Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications (NYC DOITT) Elevation Data and spatially joining (via Intersect function) Building Footprints, Roadbeds, Transportation Structures and US Census Blocks (2000) as a continuous but subdivided vector surface I was able to assign the 2D layers the Z value of the Elevation Data. The overlay rule of the data was that the elevation value would be assigned, if coincidental with the feature layer, to first the building footprint layer, then the transportation structure layer (for example, used to prevent non-building areas from being assigned bridge elevation Z-values), then the roadbed, and then the Census blocks. 

I calculate the geometric area of the building and then with the joined elevation variable (and then subtracted elevation of block area giving the 'height' of the building), multiplied Area by Height to get the Volume (or building "Envelope" or "Bulk"). Then summed the volume of all the buildings on their respective blocks and then divided by the total block area (as all blockes are not the same area). The values were then classified into quantiles. 

Then using a map of the quantiles of blocks by building bulk density I visually identified 1200 ft (check this against your maps!) walks that were either in the upper or lower quartile of building bulk density. These walks were also selected in that they were within a reasonable distance of public transit from Columbia University.
