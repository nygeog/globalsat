##Walks
The map should be clear (if zoomed in) which side of the street to walk down. 

###Direction 
If the walk is primarily North/South oriented walk from North to South. If the walk is East/West oriented walk from West to East. 

If for any chance a side of the street is impassable upon first getting to the walk, use the other side but mark it down in your notes. 

######Remember to turn the device on at the beginning and turn it off at the end of the walk

######Start and Stop RunKeeper app at the beginning and end of each walk too. 
Place the RunKeeper GPX files in the RunKeeper folder in Dropbox under your initials 'mb.'

##Turning off WAAS
To turn off the Wide Area Augmentation System Settings go to;
Settings -> Configuration 

Deselect the checkbox for WAAS for 1 of the devices for the 2 that you have.  Make sure you note which device ID has WAAS on and which has WAAS off. 

I don't have a device currently with me but here's a short [video for turning off WAAS](http://youtu.be/UgUVzm4E5UY) that might help if you are stumped.
