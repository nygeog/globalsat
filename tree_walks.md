##Walks
The map should be clear (if zoomed in) which side of the street to walk down. If the walk is primarily North/South oriented walk from North to South. If the walk is East/West oriented walk from West to East. 

If for any chance a side of the street is impassable upon first getting to the walk, use the other side but mark it down in your notes. 

##Notes to take at walks
1. Start time, start time YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS
2. If the walk was disrupted by activity or construction.
